        <Quote>The environment can be breathtakingâ€”calming, powerful, even unsettling. For me, landscapes evoke strong emotional responses. Rather than focusing on detailed realism, my goal with chalk pastels and oils is to express the feeling a scene inspires. Through my work, I hope viewers will connect with the emotion and sense of place that moved me to create it.</Quote>
