        <Quote>The environment can shift from breathtaking beauty to quiet calm, from raw power to subtle threat.Landscapes, for me, are never just seenâ€”they are felt. With chalk pastels and oils, I seek not to record every detail, but to capture the pulse, the mood, the memory of a place.Through my work, I invite viewers to step into that moment and feel the spark that first stirred me.</Quote>
